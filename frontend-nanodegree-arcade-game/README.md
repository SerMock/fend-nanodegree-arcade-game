# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

## How to play

Download the folder and open the Index.html file. The game will then appear on screen.

To play, press the arrow keys to move your character. Avoid the insects and reach the water to win! The game is endless and will keep resetting your character.

Great for mindless fun!
